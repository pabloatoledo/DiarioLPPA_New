                <p>  <!-- this is a subtitle -->
                    Qantas has announced it will begin operating non-stop flights from Sydney to London and New York from 2025.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Australia's national carrier said it had purchased a new fleet of Airbus A350-1000 jets capable of direct flights to any city in the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first Sydney-London flights will depart in late 2025 and take about 20 hours, making them the world's longest passenger flights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The route, launched in 1947, once took 58 hours and seven stops.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "The A350 and 'Project Sunrise' will make any city just one flight away from Australia," chief executive Alan Joyce said in a statement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "It's the last frontier and the final fix for the tyranny of distance."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Qantas has been working on the project for about five years, but implementation has been delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2018 it began offering direct 17-hour direct flights between London and Perth in Western Australia, and in 2019 it conducted a series of test flights from the east coast to the UK and New York.
                </p>

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The new fleet of 12 planes will begin arriving in 2025, with the order to be completed by 2028.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The airline did not say how much it would charge for seats in its four classes: first, business, premium economy and economy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each plane will be able to carry 238 passengers with 40% of the cabin dedicated to premium seating. Seats will be roomier than usual, Qantas says.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Travellers will also be able to access a "wellbeing zone" in the centre of the plane - with a self-service snack bar and space for stretching and movement - to combat the effects of spending 20 hours in the air.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently Qantas operates non-stop flights between UK and Australia, with Boeing 787s linking London's Heathrow Airport and the Northern Territory city of Darwin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The flight from Australia takes about 17 hours, and the return journey is about 16 hours long.
                </p>
